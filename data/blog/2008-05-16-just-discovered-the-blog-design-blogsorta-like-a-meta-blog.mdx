[Blog Design Blog](http://www.blogdesignblog.com/)

I definitely plan to use their tips and &#8220;Dreamworks Redux&#8221; Theme to build a new (unique) look for this site.

Even more amazing is how I found it. Used the cool twitter tool twits like me, and it pointed me to twitter id: bebizzy, the blogger that writes: [bestinations.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20190615145709/http://bestinations.com/) (very interesting Blog by the way!)

I was really impressed by his wordpress theme, and followed the link at the bottom of the page. I love the internet, it really is a series of seamless links between information.
