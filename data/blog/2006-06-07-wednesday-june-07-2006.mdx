Well, its been like two weeks since I have published on my switching experience.  What can I say, I am a crappy blogger!...enough about my procrastination, though.

So far the Mac experience hasn't been too bad (I have been at this for about two weeks, I got the mac 20 days ago, and figure it took me about a week to settle into a mac only routine, so I will call this day 13)  To further my experience, I am also using a mac mini here at work.  So I am only using the OS X Operating System (I have used my Linux desktop, but very minimally, just browsingg the internet)...wow, I use alot of parenthesis(!).

In my next posting, I am going to cover the misconception that Macs "just work".
